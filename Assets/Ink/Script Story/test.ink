Where are we, Grin?

#speaker Grin
Looks like the edge of the Forgotten Woods. You sure this is the way?

#speaker Player
Not exactly... but my compass stopped working an hour ago.

#speaker Grin
Figures. Well, what now?

#speaker Player
Let's check our surroundings first.

#speaker Grin

=== ask_grin ===
#speaker Player
What do you think we should do?

#speaker Grin

-> END

=== go_deeper ===
#speaker Player
No use waiting. Let's move deeper.

#speaker Grin
Brave or foolish, I'm still with you.
